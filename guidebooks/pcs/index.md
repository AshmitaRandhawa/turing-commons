# About this Guidebook

Welcome to the guidebook on Public Communication of Science (PCS) ðŸ‘‹

This guide has been produced to accompany the online training programme at the Alan Turing Institute. It is currently a work-in-progress, so if you are reading this please feel free to have a look aroundâ€”I like to work with the "garage door open".
