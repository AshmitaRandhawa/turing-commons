# Case Studies

The following case studies have been designed to work alongside the project lifecycle. They offer basic information to use in reflective and deliberative activities, but may also require you to fill in some gaps.

For instance, if you find that you do not have sufficient information to complete one of the subsequent activities feel free to come up with something reasonable that fits the context of the case study, and then to reflect on what this would mean in practice.

## Predicting Risk of Reoffending

```{admonition} Summary
:class: tip
A team of data scientists are developing a predictive risk assessment tool to be support sentencing decisions by judges in criminal courts. The tool will take data about a defendant and feed this into an algorithm that predicts a risk score, between 1 and 5 that is presented to the judge alongside the additional case evidence. This score will represent the likelihood of reoffending, and, therefore, inform the sentencing decision made by the judge.
