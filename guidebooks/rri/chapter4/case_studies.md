# Case Studies

The following case studies have been designed to work alongside a series of practical activities that cover the various stages of the project lifecycle. They offer only *basic* information to guide reflective and deliberative activities. If you find that you do not have sufficient information to address an issue that arises during deliberation, you should try to come up with something reasonable that fits the context of your chosen case study and then reflect on what this would mean for the project.

For example, when you reach the model selection section, you will have to consider what the benefits and risks could be for choosing a particular model over another, given the type of technology being developed. Because the focus of this course is on normative issues associated with data science and AI, we will not be training any models, so the actual outcome of choosing one model over another will require some informed speculation and reflection.

## Predicting Risk of Reoffending

```{admonition} Summary
:class: tip
A team of data scientists are developing a predictive risk assessment tool to be support sentencing decisions by judges in criminal courts. The tool will take data about a defendant and feed this into an algorithm that predicts a risk score, between 1 and 5 that is presented to the judge alongside the additional case evidence. This score will represent the likelihood of reoffending, and, therefore, inform the sentencing decision made by the judge.
