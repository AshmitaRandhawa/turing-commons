# Next Steps

The overview and summary of the project lifecycle presented in this chapter, by necessity, skips over a lot of detail.
However, it provides a useful anchor for subsequent discussion, and serves to motivate the following question:

> How do you responsibly communicate...

<!-- For instance, there may be a plurality of ethical goals relevant to the assurance of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">(model) development</span> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">system use and monitoring</span>, including demonstrating that the system being deployed is safe, secure, fair, trustworthy, explainable, sustainable, or respectful of human agency and autonomy. How do you provide assurance that the interconnected project processes and activities individually and collectively support the relevant goal? This is why we need a unifying framework and methodology that makes space for the operationalisation of end-to-end, normative considerations and complements existing regulatory culture, as opposed to merely a miscellany of practical mechanisms. -->
