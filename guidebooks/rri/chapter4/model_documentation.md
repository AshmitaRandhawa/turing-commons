# Model Documentation and Productionalization

- The limits of transparency
  - Handling sensitive information
  - Protecting against model inversion
  - Transparency is not accountability
- What needs to be documented?
  - Evaluating current tools (e.g., datasheets, factsheets, model cards, and TRIPOD)
    - Who is your audience?
    - What are you developing?
