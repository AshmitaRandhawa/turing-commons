# Model Documentation 

- The limits of transparency
  - Handling sensitive information
  - Protecting against model inversion
  - Transparency is not accountability
- What needs to be documented?
  - Evaluating current tools (e.g., datasheets, factsheets, model cards, and TRIPOD)
    - Who is your audience?
    - What are you developing?

Although the previous stages are likely to create a series of artefacts while undertaking the tasks themselves, model reporting should also be handled as a separate stage to ensure that the project team reflect on the future needs of various stakeholders and end users. While this stage is likely to include information about the performance measures used for evaluating the model (e.g. decision thresholds for classifiers, accuracy metrics), it can (and should) include wider considerations, such as intended use of the model, details of the features used, training-testing distributions, and any ethical considerations that arise from these decisions (e.g. fairness constraints, use of politically sensitive demographic features).
