# Model Updating or Deprovisioning

Model updating can occur continuously if the architecture of the system and context of its use allows for it.
Otherwise, updating the model may require either revisiting previous stages to make planned adjustments (e.g. [model training, testing and validation](../model_development/model_testing.md)).
Alternatively, if more significant alterations are required, the extant model may need to be entirely *de-provisioned* (i.e., stopping use),necessitating a return to a new round of project planning.
