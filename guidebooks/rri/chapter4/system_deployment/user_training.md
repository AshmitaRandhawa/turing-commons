# User Training

- Reproducible and replicable science
- Explainable systems
- Returning to bias: algorithmic aversion

Although the performance of the model is evaluated in earlier stages, the model's impact cannot be entirely evaluated without consideration of the human factors that affect its performance in real-world settings. The impact of human cognitive biases, such as algorithmic aversion [^aversion] must also be considered, as such biases can lead to over- and under-reliance on the model (or system), in turn negating any potential benefits that may arise from its use. Understanding the social and environmental context is also vital, as sociocultural norms may contribute to how training is received, and how the system itself is evaluated (see {cite:p}`burton2020`).
