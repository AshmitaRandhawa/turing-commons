# Data Extraction and Procurement

Ideally, the project team should have a clear idea in mind (from the planning and problem formulation stages) of what data are needed prior to collection, extraction, or procurement.
This can help mitigate risks associated with over-collection of data (e.g. increased privacy or security concerns) and help align the project with values such as *data minimisation* {cite:p}`ico2020`.
Of course, this stage may need to be revisited after carrying out subsequent tasks (e.g. data analysis, preprocessing, model testing) if it is clear that insufficient or imbalanced data were collected to achieve the project's goals.

Where data is procured, questions about provenance arise (e.g. legal issues, concerns about informed consent of human data subjects).
For instance, what information about the dataset is necessary to provide sufficient assurance to the team that they are procuring data that has been reliably collected by another party.
Or, will they be able to reuse and repurpose the data for their intended project.
The procured data will need to be sufficiently representative of the intended target domain of the project if it is to be useful.

Generally, addressing these issues and ensuring responsible data extraction and procurement requires the incorporation of myriad forms of expertise into decision-making. This can include,

- legal expertise (e.g., data protection officer) who is able to inform the project team of the relevant lawful bases for data collection and help;
- ethical expertise (e.g., whether the various rights and freedoms of data subjects have been properly respected);
- domain expertise (e.g., whether the method of original data collection, the expected quantity of data, and the variety of features, will be sufficient based on the problem being addressed, as formulated in the previous stage); and
- personal expertise (e.g., whether the data subjects are likely to be willing to provide access to all the data being requested)
