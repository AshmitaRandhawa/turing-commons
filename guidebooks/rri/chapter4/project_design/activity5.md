# Activity 5: Privilege Walk

Individuals may be affected by technology in different ways.
This is uncontroversial.
Someone with a qualification in network engineering may benefit from the addition of a new feature to their internet service, which allows them greater customisation over their network traffic, whereas the majority of customers may never be able to make use of the feature due to a lack of required expertise.
Alternatively, many members of the public may find that the use of automated facial recognition technology for passport photo verification is helpful, whereas some individuals with darker skin may find that the system is biased and fails to work for them as expected causing discriminatory forms of harm [^bbc].

[^bbc]: This example is real, and was reported on by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54349538) who carried out the research, which was supported by the Alan Turing Institute. The research found that women with darker skin were more than twice as likely to be told their photos fail UK passport rules when they submit them online than lighter-skinned men.

Whether someone benefits from research and innovation or is harmed by it, can depend on their comparative levels of social privilege.
For instance, in the case of the network engineer, their *education* confers a privilege on them that other individuals may not have.
Similarly, those with darker skin may be disadvantaged by the deployment of a technology, in ways that other more privileged groups are not.

It can be very difficult to identify all the ways in which individuals or stakeholders may be privileged, but it is important to reflect on these considerations to be sure that the benefits or harms of your research or innovation project are fairly distributed or targeted in the way you intend.

To this end, the following activity is designed to help you think about a variety of privileges using some personas and an activity known as a 'privilege walk'.
