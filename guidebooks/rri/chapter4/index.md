# 4 The Project Lifecycle

```{admonition} Summary
:class: tip
In this chapter we will work our way through the key stages of the project lifecycle: (project) design, (model) development, and (system) deployment. For each stage, we will describe the accompanying activities, and highlight some of the salient ethical, social, and legal issues. However, this is presented at a relatively high-level of abstraction in the guide, because the material relies heavily on the use of [case studies](case_studies.md) and accompanying activities to flesh out some of the context-specific issues. Therefore, if you are reading this chapter as part of an individual, self-directed study, you may have to adapt the activities a little.

```{admonition} Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will:

- Gain a high-level understanding of the central stages of the project lifecycle: (project) design, (model) development, and (system) deployment.
- Explore the activities that are associated with each of the three stages, focusing on salient ethical, social, and legal issues.
- If you are following this material as part of a live course, you will also engage in practical discussions and activities, using several illustrative case studies to help you better understand how to conduct responsible data science and AI.
