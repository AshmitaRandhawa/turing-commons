The second part will cover activities and topics related to responsible data extraction, procurement, analysis and management.

```{admonition} Learning Objectives

- look at how you can set your project up to succeed at the earliest stages of project planning and problem formulation, and ensure that issues do not cascade downstream to later stages of the project lifecycle 
- gain an understanding of what it means to act responsibly with respect to the data protection and privacy rights and expectations of data subjects
- explore how social, statistical, and cognitive biases affects data analysis, and what ought to be done to minimise the effect of these biases
