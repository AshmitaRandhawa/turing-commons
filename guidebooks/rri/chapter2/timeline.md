# Science and Technology Studies (A Timeline)

This section provides a timeline for Science and Technology Studies (STS), which can be treated as a reference and an optional resource for the RRI course.

Science and technology studies (STS) is the interdisciplinary study of how science and technology shape, structure, affect and interact with society, politics, and cultural knowledge and values.
Because of its inherent interdisciplinarity, it arose as the result of the convergence of different ideas and areas of interest, each of which have their own distinct histories.
However, many of these intertwined ideas shared important themes, such as (a) viewing science as a social institution with a distinct normative structure (e.g., values of prioritising novel research; ethos and community of peers), (b)) treating science and technology as socially situated practices, and (c) the belief that technology and society co-constitute and mutually shape each other, including the way that scientific facts and technological artefacts are understood and conceptualised {cite}`merton1973`.
As Rohracher notes:

```{epigraph}
Facts and artifacts are but temporarily stable outcomes of heterogeneous activities of scientists and engineers and their entanglement in wider social and political relations.

-- {cite:t}`rohracher2015`
```

Because of these themes, the concerns of STS overlap closely with the concerns of RRI.
Therefore, the following potted (and incomplete) history of STS provides a reference to some notable publications and events that you may find interesting to explore.[^Rohracher]

[^Rohracher]: The following timelines is based on the account by {cite}`rohracher2015`, which goes back further than the 1960s.

## 1960s: Influential Precursors to STS

- (1962) Thomas Kuhn publishes, 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'.
  - This book challenged the idea of technological determinism by suggesting that science does not progress as a accumulation of accepted facts and theories {cite}`kuhn1996`. Rather, Kuhn proposes, it follows an episodic model in which periods of ''normal science'' are punctuated by revolutions in thought, due to a crisis with the dominant paradigm's ability to account for anomalies.
- Women's studies grows as an academic field.
  - The 1960s saw the accreditation of specific courses in the U.S., which begin to examine how social and cultural constructs of gender, and structural forms of oppression intersect with other key theoretical terms in the behavioural and social sciences.
- (1968) Garrett Hardin publishes an essay in *Science* that popularises the phrase ''tragedy of the commons''.
  - Hardin's focus was on economic science and the problem of overpopulation on finite and dwindling environmental resources.

## 1970s: STS Emerges

- (1972) [Elting E. Morison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elting_E._Morison)—a historian of technology—takes up the Killian Chair of the Humanities at MIT and helps develop the first STS program.
- 1979) Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar publish the first edition of their study, 'Laboratory Life' {cite}`latour1986`.
  - This book was based on field work that took an anthropological approach to scientific practice and the laboratory culture, in order to develop an argument that scientific practice was localised and that specific centres (e.g., laboratories) were the locus of knowledge production, but rooted in their respective social and political cultures.

## 1980s: The Social Construction of Technology

- (1981) The European Association for the Study of Science and Technology is formed to represent academics and researchers in the fields of STS.
- (1984) Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker publish, ‘The social construction of facts and artifacts: or how the sociology of science and the sociology of technology might benefit each other'.
  - The article paved the way for a series of challenges to the belief in an inherent logic of technological development that exists independent of the value-laden design choices of the manufacturers.
- (Late 1980s) Actor-Network Theory is developed at the Centre de Sociologie de l’Innovation, a small research center at the École des Mines de Paris.
  - Actor-network theory (ANT) is a constructivist theory, which challenges the use of distinct social and technological facts to build explanations of observable phenomena. Rather, ANT claims that the ''sociotechnical'' is an assemblage (or, network) of human and non-human entities, and that our sociotechnical reality is constructed from within this network, rather than as impartial observers viewing it from above.

## 1990s: Engaging Power and Feminist STS

- (1991) Donna Harraway publishes ‘Situated knowledges: the science question in feminism and the privilege of partial perspective' and Judy Wajcman publishes 'Feminism Confronts Technology'.
  - Both works contribute to feminist standpoint theory by highlighting how attempts *to know* are socially situated, and that male dominated scientific practices and institutions often fail to reflect the distinct, lived experiences of women. However, their focus on oppressive practices can also expose how discriminatory forms of power affect other marginalised groups.
- (1991) Sandra Harding publishes 'Whose Science? Whose Knowledge? Thinking From Women's Lives.'
  - Summarised in the phrase, ''science is politics by other means'', this book also shows how science and technologically-enabled capitalism exclude and oppress women, while also being complicit in the production and perpetuation of other marginalisations.
- (1999) {cite:t}`hacking1999` publishes the 'Social Construction of What?''.
  - In this book, Hacking provides a plausible account of why the debates regarding the social construction of science and technology have become so heated. In short, if one can argue that something is socially constructed then it follows that its existence is not inevitable and could be changed. For those who are critical of the oppressive and marginalising effects of science and technology, this is an important stepping stone. Described by one reviewer as a ''peacekeeping mission'' of sorts {cite}`larvor2000`, Hacking's book tries to take some of the heat out of these debates by clarifying what is actually up for debate, and where there can be space, for example, ''in the case of our most serious psychopathologies, for both the constructionist and the biologist.'' {cite:t}`hacking1999`

## 2000s (and onwards): Deliberative Democracy and Public Policy

- (2000) The UK's House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology publish a report titled 'Science and Society'.
  - This report drew attention to a perceived crisis in public trust towards science and technology (e.g., biotechnology) and scientific expertise. The report dealt with many themes that are still important today, such as public understanding of science, the communication of risk and uncertainty, science and the media, and public engagement in science as a key part of deliberative (or, participatory) democracy.
- (2002) H.M. Collins and Robert Evans explore the notion of 'scientific expertise' as it relates to public decision-making {cite}`collins2002`.
  - Following earlier calls for the 'democratisation of science' {cite}`feyerabend1978`, Collins' and Evans' article helped shape a growing call for greater public involvement in science, to help (partially) ensure that science and technology keep pace with political decision-making.
- (2009) Sheila Jasonoff and Sang-Hyun Kim introduce the concept  of ‘‘sociotechnical imaginaries'' {cite}`jasanoff2009`
  - Sociotechnical imaginaries are future-oriented visions of how science and technology could shape society. Through a comparative analysis of the different ways that the sociopolitical institutions of the US and South Korea regulated nuclear power, Jasanoff and Kim emphasised how non-scientific actors can affect the promotion and reception of science and technology policy in society with varying conceptual visions.
