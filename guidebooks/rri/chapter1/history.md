# A Short History of RRI

The term 'responsible research and innovation' is most strongly associated with the European Commission's Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development—a set of funding programmes that support research in the European Union. Beginning with the seventh framework programme in 2010, and continuing on through Horizon 2020 (FP8), the term 'responsible research and innovation' became increasingly important for the European Commission's policy.

Since then, other national funding bodies have also shown a commitment to RRI. For example, UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council have developed the AREA framework, which sets out four principles for RRI: Anticipate, Reflect, Engage, and Act (AREA).

In almost all cases, two significant and motivating drivers behind these policies are (a) an awareness of the impact that science and technology can have on society, and (b) an appreciation of the need to include the public in a dialogue about how science and technology should shape society. The following three case studies also help to provide illustrations of these points.

## Case Study 1: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment

Starting in 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service ran a study of “untreated syphilis in the male Negro”, which affected almost 400 African-American men with the disease {cite:p}`reverby2001`. As we know today, Syphilis can cause many symptoms including sores, blindness, hair loss, stroke, heart failure, and even death if left untreated. However, aside from the risk that these men were exposed to, a particularly abusive aspect of the study was that it was carried out on impoverished individuals, affected by the Great Depression, all while telling them they were being “treated” for their “bad blood” {cite:p}`reverby2001`.

The study created a massive outcry but, nevertheless, continued for 40 years until 1972. In this time, syphilis became treatable as a result of the increased availability of penicillin, and funding for the study was withdrawn. However, as one of the participants states,

> ''The thing that disturbs me now is that they found a cure,'' Shaw told the Baltimore Sun. ''They found penicillin. And they never gave it to us. It vexed me awfully sadly.'' {cite:p}`duff-brown2017`

By the time the study did end, 128 participants had died from syphilis or related complications. Moreover, 40 of the participants’ spouses had been infected, and 19 children were born with congenital syphilis. It should be obvious why this case study is infamous and also well rehearsed in courses on research ethics or biomedical ethics {cite:p}`beauchamp2013`. However, there are many reasons for the studies continued infamy that have direct relevance to RRI, including the need to continually reflect on the structural biases that exist in society and create forms of racial discrimination that researchers should not ignore. One specific consideration is the fact that the study directly influenced a landmark event in the ethical importance of informed consent: the 1979 Belmont Report {cite:p}`nationalcommission1979`.

This report, produced by the US National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, set out a variety of guidelines for clinical research, including the requirement for participants to have an understanding of the research being conducted, in order to provide informed consent.

> Respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is provided when adequate standards for informed consent are satisfied.

The conditions that need to be satisfied are,

1) Disclosure of sufficient information
2) Ensuring participant's comprehension
3) Voluntarily providing consent

Neither (1) nor (2) were satisfied in the Tuskegee study, and it would be difficult to argue that (3) was satisfied given the socioeconomic deprivation which affected the participants.

Aside from the historical importance of this study, its inclusion here is also to help highlight why so much significance is placed on the responsible participation of stakeholder and affected users or individuals in present day research and activity. We will say more about this in the next section.

## Case Study 2: Human Genome Project

## Case Study 3: Cambridge Analytica

In 2013, three researchers at the University of Cambridge and Microsoft Research published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper was titled, 'Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior', and it provided details of an application (MyPersonality) that allowed Facebook users to participate in a range of psychometric tests, including a personality test, an intelligence test, and a Satisfaction with Life survey.

Following these tests, users were asked if they were happy for their social media profile data to be collected for research purposes. This included, where available, the various “Likes” of the users; their age, gender, sexual orientation, relationship status, political views, religion, and social network information (e.g. network density); details of the users’ consumption of alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes, and whether their parents stayed together until the user was 21 years old; and also visual inspection of profile pictures, in order to assign ethnicity to a randomly selected subsample of users.

The purpose of gathering this information was to see whether psychological traits could be predicted from social media data. In short, could the results from the user's psychometric tests be inferred from the data gathered from their social media profiles. The results were mixed and gave rise to many questions about validity, reliability, and generalisability {cite:p}`burr2019`. However, the results or these related questions are not our present concern.

Almost four years after the publication of their research paper, in 2017, Donald Trump was inaugurated as President of the United States and the United Kingdom gave formal notice of its intent to withdraw from the EU following the Brexit referendum. In an attempt to make sense of these surprising events, a large number of investigative journalists started contacting the three researchers enquiring about their links to a political consulting firm known as Cambridge Analytica. Despite having never worked with Cambridge Analytica, and refusing their requests, the method the researchers described in their 2013 paper led the firm to work with another Cambridge University researcher to develop their own app {cite:p}`weaver2018`. It was later revealed that this app enabled Cambridge Analytica to access the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge or permission due to poor data privacy and protection policies on the platform {cite:p}`kang2018`. The firm subsequently used this data to develop and sell predictive analytics services to the Trump administration, influencing the outcomes of the US election, and also attempt to court the Leave.EU Brexit campaign {cite:p}`ball2020`.

The events that surround the Cambridge Analytica data scandal read as though they were plucked from a novel about espionage, information warfare, and PSYOPS, carefully woven together and exposed by the tireless efforts of investigative journalists {cite:p}`cadwalladr2017`. Our interest in the case study is, unfortunately, less glamorous. It can be captured by a single question:

> If you were one of the original researchers, back in 2013, investigating whether social media data could be used to infer otherwise private information about the psychological attitudes and beliefs of users, would you think you were behaving irresponsibly by publishing your research?
