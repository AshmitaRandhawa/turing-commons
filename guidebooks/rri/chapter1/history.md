# A Short History of RRI

The term 'responsible research and innovation' is most strongly associated with the European Commission's Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development—a set of funding programmes that support research in the European Union. Beginning with the seventh framework programme in 2010, and continuing on through Horizon 2020 (FP8), the term 'responsible research and innovation' became increasingly important for the European Commission's policy.

Since then, other national funding bodies have also shown a commitment to RRI. For example, UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council have developed the AREA framework, which sets out four principles for RRI: Anticipate, Reflect, Engage, and Act (AREA).

In almost all cases, two significant and motivating drivers behind these policies are (a) an awareness of the impact that science and technology can have on society, and (b) an appreciation of the need to include the public in a dialogue about how science and technology should shape society. The following three case studies also help to provide illustrations of these points.

## Case Study 1: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment

Starting in 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service ran a study of “untreated syphilis in the male Negro”, which affected almost 400 African-American men with the disease {cite:p}`reverby2001`. As we know today, Syphilis can cause many symptoms including sores, blindness, hair loss, stroke, heart failure, and even death if left untreated. However, aside from the risk that these men were exposed to, a particularly abusive aspect of the study was that it was carried out on impoverished individuals, affected by the Great Depression, all while telling them they were being “treated” for their “bad blood” {cite:p}`reverby2001`.

The study created a massive outcry but, nevertheless, continued for 40 years until 1972. In this time, syphilis became treatable as a result of the increased availability of penicillin, and funding for the study was withdrawn. However, as one of the participants states,

> ''The thing that disturbs me now is that they found a cure,'' Shaw told the Baltimore Sun. ''They found penicillin. And they never gave it to us. It vexed me awfully sadly.'' {cite:p}`duff-brown2017`

<!-- The outcry over the study, which affected approximately 399 African-American men with the disease and 201 controls, led to a lawsuit, Senate hearings, a federal investigation, and new rules about informed consent. It provided a powerful metaphor for racism, ethical mistakes, and the danger of state-run medical research. It has also generated rumors, historical monographs, videos, documentaries, plays, poems, music, a movie, photo-montages, a surgeon general’s nomination hearings, a presidential apology, a com- mon topic for IRB training, new memorials, and a National Bioethics Institute -->
