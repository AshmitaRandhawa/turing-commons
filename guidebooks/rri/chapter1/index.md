# What is Responsible Research and Innovation?

```{admonition} Learning Objectives
1. To understand what is meant by the term ‘responsibility’.
2. To familiarise yourself with several principles that characterise RRI.
3. To explore illustrative and historical case studies.
4. To reflect on how the interactions between science, technology, and society give rise to many normative issues.

```{admonition} Summary
:class: tip
This section defines the term 'responsible', as it occurs in 'responsible research and innovation', and also explores a short history of RRI with reference to notable events and case studies that help illustrate central themes and issues. This helps to set the foundation for the remainder of the course, which will rely on many of the core concepts that are introduced. However, the section also plays a motivating role by emphasising the interconnected nature of science, technology, and society.

## Defining 'Responsibility'

If we want a systematic and reliable method for evaluating projects, whether past, present, or future cases of research and innovation we need to be able to define what it means to be responsible. Fortunately, we don't have to start from scratch.

In an often cited article, Von Schomberg [@[[vonschomberg2011]]] defines RRI as follows:

> “Responsible Research and Innovation is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society).”

This is a helpful definition, but it can be challenging to grasp its meaning on first glance, so let's break it down.

First, we have RRI described as a "transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other". This is straightforward enough. Without transparency and interaction, research or innovation cannot be meaningfully scrutinised or challenged by affected stakeholders, and possible harms or unintended consequences may go unnoticed. If, for example, a medical research team failed to explain to their study participants the risks of a novel drug they are testing, the lack of transparency may prevent the participants from giving their meaningful and informed consent.

This connects with the second point of Von Schomberg's definition: "with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process". The process of (responsible) research and innovation is necessarily dialogical and inclusive because it acknowledges an inherent pluralism of values that are implicated within the research and innovation lifecycle. For instance, many would agree that technological advances in renewable energy are desirable because of their contribution to a more sustainable future. But there may be disagreement about specific projects, such as the development of a hydroelectric power plant that displaces downstream communities by disrupting the local ecology. Such a tension between values can only be observed and resolved through a transparent and interactive process.

Finally, von Schomberg's definition draws our attention to how responsible research and innovation facilitates a "proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society". This is another way of saying that science does not operate in a vacuum. It draws our attention to not only the fact that the practices and processes of scientific research or technological innovation occur at a specific place and time, but also to the an awareness of their consequences, which can vary in scope and impact. Obvious examples such as the development of the atomic bomb, the discovery of penicillin, or the invention of the internet may spring to mind. But all research and innovation has the potential to reshape society and social norms  or expectations. Responsible research and innovation takes this embedding as a starting point, taking seriously the moral duties and obligations that such an embedding inculcates.

This definition helps to make clear the importance of context for identifying the scope of societal responsibility, and subsequently helps emphasise the need for *engagement* in delineating this scope. But other key characteristics and principles of RRI remain under the surface. There are several frameworks for RRI that we could turn to and explore to identify the remaining principles. However, this would create the impression of a top-down approach, in which we start with pre-determine principles that determine whether research or innovation is responsible or not. This would be misleading.

Responsible Research and Innovation is a normative framework that has been constructed slowly and iteratively in response to felt injustices and social harms. The principles that have emerged have been shaped by such events, so before we discuss them it would be worth exploring some of the most notable historical case studies.

- Responsible research and innovation relies on both the organic and creative nature of the human mind as much as it does the meticulous standards of the scientific method.
- The demands of responsibility require us to reflect on the systemic influences on the research and innovation lifecycle, and the wider impacts on society.
- Responsible research and innovation is about more than the avoidance of gross misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, fabrication/falsification of results, developing obviously dangerous technologies). Irresponsible research can often occur in the absence of any individual's malicious attitudes, but rather from a failure to consider how institutional practices influence the scientific process.
- Ulrich Beck, a German sociologist, calls this phenomenon “**organized irresponsibility**.”

<!-- ## A Short History of RRI

### Case Study 1: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment

### Case Study 2: Human Genome Project

### Case Study 3: Cambridge Analytica

#### Activity 1: Exploring Case Studies
- Can you think of any other famous cases of (ir)responsible research or innovation?
- What about cases of responsible research and innovation?
- What features of either the project or the output of the project helped to determine whether it was an example of responsible versus irresponsible research or innovation?

## Science , Technology, and Society
- The value of stakeholder engagement
	- Social value of ensuring that research and innovation are responsive to and supportive of social goals
	- Ethical value of mitigating bias or risk of harm that arises from limited perspectives
	- Instrumental value for effective research and innovation

### Activity 2: Ethical Reflection and Deliberation
- Can you identify an ethical challenge or question in your life or research?
- Which actors and subjects are involved?
- What are the priorities and values of these different actors and subjects?
- Are there any tensions that arise between them? -->
