# Activty 1: Contributing to Collaborative Projects

In a later chapter, we will look at why active contribution to clear and accessible documentation is an important means for ensuring responsibility in collaborative projects. However, the need to support asynchronous collaboration poses challenges when working in large teams. I'm sure we have all experienced the feeling of despair that arises when trying to find the most recent version of a draft article in your inbox, and finding multiple instances of document_v1.docx, document_v1.1.docx, document_final.docx, document_final_v2.doc...

An increasingly popular means document version control is GitHub. While originally used by software developers wishing to share and contribute to code, the platform also has a range of features that make it ideal for managing scientific research projects. As such, it is frequently recommended by those in the Open Science community. The following video offers a useful introduction for those of you who may be unfamiliar with the platform. If you are new to GitHub, pay attention to the discussion of branches, issues, and pull requests specificallyâ€”we will be using these features in the current activity.

## Saying "Hello" and Opening a Pull Request

This activity is a relatively easy one, but it's also very important for some of the later activities. By the end of the activity you will have

- Created a GitHub account (if you don't have one already)
- Introduced yourself by using an issue and a branch, relevant to the course
- Submitted a pull request that will allow you to be added as a contributor to this course's repository
