# Project Planning and Problem Formulation

In terms of the social understanding of problem formulation, consider the following:

> An AI system that is designed to diagnose diseases based on relevant symptoms or indicators (e.g., biomarkers) would likely develop a problem formulation that assumes that any "disease" ought to be identified, regardless of whether the individual could afford the treatment, whether such a treatment is even available, or whether the individual would self-identify as "ill" or as a patient. Such assumptions are to be expected from the perspective of societies with highly-developed technical medical systems, but are more exclusionary of standpoints that emphasis preventative lifestyle approaches over reactive medical interventions (von Schomberg, 2011)
