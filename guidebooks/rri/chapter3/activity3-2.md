# Activty 4: Contributing to Collaborative Projects

In a [later section](../chapter4/model_development/model_reporting.md), we will look at why active contribution to clear and accessible documentation is an important means for ensuring responsibility in collaborative projects.
However, the need to support asynchronous collaboration poses challenges when working in large teams.
I'm sure we have all experienced the feeling of despair that arises when trying to find the most recent version of a draft article in your inbox, and finding multiple instances of files named, `document_v1.docx`, `document_v1.1.docx`, `document_final.docx`, `document_final_v2.doc`... and so on!

## Enter GitHub :octocat:

GitHub has become an increasingly popular solution to address this challenge of document version control.
While originally used by software developers wishing to share and contribute to code, the platform also has a range of features that make it ideal for managing scientific research projects.
As such, it is frequently recommended by those in the [Open Science](https://openlifesci.org) community.
If you are completely new to GitHub, the following video offers a useful introduction.
Be sure to pay attention to the discussion of branches, issues, and pull requests specificallyâ€”we will be using these features in the current activity.

## Saying "Hello" and Opening a Pull Request

```{warning}
Unfortunately, this activity can only be done when using this guide as part of an instructor-led training course.
However, there are other ways to use GitHub to contribute to this project ([click here](https://github.com/chrisdburr/turing-commons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
```

This activity is a relatively easy one, but it's also very important for some of the later activities. You will be guided through the following steps, which you will then perform yourself:

1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one already)
2. Explore the Turing Commons Repository
3. Fork the repository to your own account
4. Switch to the branch for your specific online workshop
5. Introduce yourself by adding to an issue
6. Submit a pull request to be added as a contributor to the course's repository

Activity 3: Contributing to Collaborative Projects

If you are following this guide as part of an online course, there is an associated activity that is designed to help you collaborate with your team.
Please visit https://bit.ly/3lL2KTc to view the associated activity.

If you are reading this as a self-directed exercise, you can instead visit https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/ to read more about collaborative research.
