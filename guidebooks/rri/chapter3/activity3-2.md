# Activty 4: Contributing to Collaborative Projects

In a [later section](../chapter4/model_development/model_reporting.md), we will look at why active contribution to clear and accessible documentation is an important means for ensuring responsibility in collaborative projects.
However, the need to support asynchronous collaboration poses challenges when working in large teams.
I'm sure we have all experienced the feeling of despair that arises when trying to find the most recent version of a draft article in your inbox, and finding multiple instances of files named, `document_v1.docx`, `document_v1.1.docx`, `document_final.docx`, `document_final_v2.doc`... and so on!

## Enter GitHub 

GitHub has become an increasingly popular solution to address this challenge of document version control.
While originally used by software developers wishing to share and contribute to code, the platform also has a range of features that make it ideal for managing scientific research projects.
As such, it is frequently recommended by those in the [Open Science](https://openlifesci.org) community.
If you are completely new to GitHub, the following video offers a useful introduction.
Be sure to pay attention to the discussion of branches, issues, and pull requests specificallyâ€”we will be using these features in the current activity.

## Familiarising Yourself with GitHub

```{warning}
Unfortunately, this activity can only be done when using this guide as part of an instructor-led training course.
However, there are other ways to use GitHub to contribute to this project ([click here](https://github.com/chrisdburr/turing-commons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
```

This activity is a relatively easy one, but it's also very important for some of the later activities.
You will be guided through the following steps, which you will then perform yourself:

1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one already)
2. Explore the Turing Commons Repository
3. Make a contribution
   - Fork the repository to your own account
   - Make a change to the [Participants](../further_resources/participants.md) file
   - Submit a "pull request"
4. Add to an issue, and list yourself as a contributor

### Create a GitHub account

This is the easiest of the steps.
Head on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/join) and sign-up for a free account.

### Explore the Turing Commons Repository

Perhaps you have already visited this using the link at the top of this page.
If not, head on over to this [book's repository](https://github.com/chrisdburr/turing-commons).

You will be greeted with a page that has a list of tabs along the top, a series of files and directories, and a section title README.md.
This is the homepage for the Turing Commons repository (or, 'repo' for short).
This is where all the files that are used to compile the website that you're currently reading this text from is stored. 
Feel free to click through the directories and open up the files.
The `guidebooks` directory is probably the most interesting place to browse.

### Fork the Repository

The next step is to "fork" the repo to your own account.
In short, this is creating a personal copy of the repository to your own account, which you can then freely edit.

Now, in your own copy of the repository, head on over to the following file:

> `guidebooks/rri/further_resources/participants.md`

Here, you can add your own GitHub username and leave a comment about your feelings for the course so far.
Be careful to pay attention to the formatting.

Once you've done this, you

Activity 3: Contributing to Collaborative Projects

If you are following this guide as part of an online course, there is an associated activity that is designed to help you collaborate with your team.
Please visit https://bit.ly/3lL2KTc to view the associated activity.

If you are reading this as a self-directed exercise, you can instead visit https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/ to read more about collaborative research.
