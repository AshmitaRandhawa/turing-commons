# Welcome 

Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
This is the Turing Commonsâ€”a home for resources and tools to help you reflect, discuss, and take responsibility for the design, development, and use of data-driven technologies.

Confused by that last sentence?
Don't worry you're still in the right place.
We have a range of resources for those curious about the ethical and responsible use of data, regardless of whether you're a curious citizen looking to have greater control over local matters, or a data scientist looking to take more responsibility over the consequences of your research.

This site is, however, a living resource, which means the content is constantly being updated, revised, and refined. At present, the site is a home for several guidebooks, which have been designed for specific training courses we are in the process of delivering.

These guidebooks are themselves being updated and added to, so may be in different states of completeness and readiness:

- [Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)](rri/index.md)
- [Public Communication of Science (PCS)](pcs/index.md)
- [AI Ethics & Governance (AEG)](aeg/index.md)
