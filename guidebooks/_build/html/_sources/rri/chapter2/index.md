# Responsible Data Science and AI

## The Data Science and AI Project Project Lifecycle

<!-- - Introduce the project lifecycle
- Give short descriptions of each stage (use an illustrative example) -->

Designing, developing, and deploying an AI system is not a one-person task. The activities and processes which comprise a typical AI project lifecycle involve a wide-ranging and far-reaching set of skills and capacities. Such skills are usually encapsulated within myriad roles and responsibilities: project commissioner, product manager, data protection officer, data scientist, system engineer, etc. However, the way such roles and responsibilities are often defined at an organisational or institutional level (e.g. in job specifications) tend to reflect the practical demands of organisational efficiency or HR management, rather than the normative demands of ethical and responsible governance.

In reality, the individual roles and responsibilities, which are implicated in the design, development, and deployment of complex AI projects, are interwoven to such an extent that they form an inextricable Gordian Knot of collective responsibility. While there will always remain a pragmatic need to have individual roles and responsibilities for complex projects, which may be undertaken by a single person or a team, due to the inescapable burden of time constraints and finite cognitive resources, such a pragmatic consideration does not provide the individual project member with a morally defensible reason for excusing themselves from the shared and collective responsibility.

What is needed, however, is a clear illustration of how this collective responsibility is instantiated throughout the lifecycle of an AI project—or a project involving the development of a data-driven technology. Figure 1 seeks to address this need, initially, at a high-level of abstraction, before being expanded upon through a more detailed discussion and exploration of the constitutive stages.[^caveat]

[^caveat]: It is important to note that this schematic simplifies many details that characterise an actual AI project lifecycle. Such an abstraction is intentional and necessary for the current purpose, which is to establish a framework for thinking about how the interacting roles and responsibilities implicated in a real-world project form an inextricable collective responsibility for reflective and responsive deliberation.  

<!-- ### Activity 1: 

## Roles and Responsibilities
- No one person is involved in all the stages of the project lifecycle, and in some cases multiple teams may be required 
- This necessitates a collective responsibility and a recognition of interconnected roles.
	- What is collective responsibility?
	- How should roles be defined and agreed?

## Reflect, Act, Justify—A Participatory Procedure for RRI
- What is the reflect, act, and justify process?
	- Explain each of the three stages.
- How is it different to the AREA framework? -->
