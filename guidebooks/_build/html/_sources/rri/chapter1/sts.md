# Science , Technology, and Society

<!-- - The value of stakeholder engagement
  - Social value of ensuring that research and innovation are responsive to and supportive of social goals
  - Ethical value of mitigating bias or risk of harm that arises from limited perspectives
  - Instrumental value for effective research and innovation
- RRI relies on both the organic and creative nature of the human mind as much as it does the meticulous standards of the scientific method.
- The demands of responsibility require us to reflect on the systemic influences on the research and innovation lifecycle, and the wider impacts on society.
- RRI is about more than the avoidance of gross misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, fabrication/falsification of results, developing obviously dangerous technologies). Irresponsible research can often occur in the absence of any individual's malicious attitudes, but rather from a failure to consider how institutional practices influence the scientific process.
- Ulrich Beck, a German sociologist, calls this phenomenon â€œ**organized irresponsibility**". -->

> Responsible research and innovation is an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation. {cite:p}`europeancommission2014`
