# Data Extraction and Procurement

Ideally, the project team should have a clear idea in mind (from the planning and problem formulation stages) of what data are needed prior to extracting or procuring them. This can help mitigate risks associated with over-collection of data (e.g. increased privacy or security concerns) and help align the project with values such as *data minimisation* {cite:p}`ico2020`. Of course, this stage may need to be revisited after carrying out subsequent tasks (e.g. preprocessing, model testing) if it is clear that insufficient or imbalanced data were collected to achieve the project's goals. Where data is procured, questions about provenance arise (e.g. legal issues, concerns about informed consent of human data subjects). Generally, responsible data extraction and procurement require the incorporation of domain expertise into decision-making so that desiderata of data minimisation as well as of securing relevant and sufficient data can be integrated into design choices.

- Respecting rights of data subjects
- Reusing dataâ€”what do you need to know about the provenance of a dataset?
