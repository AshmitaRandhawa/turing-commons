# Model Updating or Deprovisioning 

- De-provisioning is not really an option in research

As noted previously, model updating can occur continuously if the architecture of the system and context of its use allows for it. Otherwise, updating the model may require either revisiting previous stages to make planned adjustments (e.g. model selection and training), or if more significant alterations are required the extant model may need to be entirely de-provisioned, necessitating a return to a new round of project planning.

[^aversion]: Algorithmic aversion refers to the reluctance of human agents to incorporate algorithmic tools as part of their decision-making processes due to misaligned expectations of the algorithm's performance (see {cite:p}`burton2020`).

This overview and summary of the project lifecycle is by necessity an abstraction. However, it provides a useful anchor for subsequent discussion, and serves to motivate the following question: how do you provide assurance for the diversity of tasks included throughout the process? For instance, there may be a plurality of ethical goals relevant to the assurance of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">(model) development</span> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">system use and monitoring</span>, including demonstrating that the system being deployed is safe, secure, fair, trustworthy, explainable, sustainable, or respectful of human agency and autonomy. How do you provide assurance that the interconnected project processes and activities individually and collectively support the relevant goal? This is why we need a unifying framework and methodology that makes space for the operationalisation of end-to-end, normative considerations and complements existing regulatory culture, as opposed to merely a miscellany of practical mechanisms.
