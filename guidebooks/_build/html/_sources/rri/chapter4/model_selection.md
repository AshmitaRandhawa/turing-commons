# Model Selection

- Selecting models for interpretability
- The limitations of technical tools for fairness
- Model generalisability

This stage determines the model type and structure that will be produced in the next stages. In some projects, model selection will result in multiple models for the purpose of comparison based on some performance metric (e.g. accuracy). In other projects, there may be a need to first of all implement a pre-existing set of formal models into code. The class of relevant models is likely to have been highly constrained by many of the previous stages (e.g. available resources and skills, problem formulation), for instance, where the problem demands a supervised learning algorithm instead of an unsupervised learning algorithm; or where explainability considerations require a more interpretable model (e.g. a decision tree).
