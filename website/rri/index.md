	- A logo or icon that can indicate a specific section
	- Images (e.g. photos and illustrations)
	- Supporting graphics (e.g. frames that look like a computer program window, data visualisations)
	- Tables
	- Text boxes for activities and supplementary information
	- Quotations
	- References and Citations
		- Each citation will reference an article, website, or report, and the full information will be included at the end of the guide in the bibliography.
		- This is a sentence with a citation that will appear in the main guide (Smith, 2021).
