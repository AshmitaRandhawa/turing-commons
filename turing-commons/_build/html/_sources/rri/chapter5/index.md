# Responsible Model Development
### Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Feature selection and representation
- Handling missing data

### Model Selection, Training, and Testing
- Selecting models for interpretability
- The limitations of technical tools for fairness 
- Model generalisability

### Model Documentation and Deployment
- The limits of transparency
	- Handling sensitive information 
	- Protecting against model inversion
	- Transparency is not accountability
- What needs to be documented?
	- Evaluating current tools (e.g., datasheets, factsheets, model cards, and TRIPOD)
		- Who is your audience?
		- What are you developing?
